📘 DSA Algorithm Assignments – GitHub Repository

This repository contains implementations of important Data Structures & Algorithms applied to real-world case studies. Each assignment focuses on problem-solving, algorithm analysis, and optimization for large datasets.

🚀 Assignments Included
1. Merge Sort – Customer Order Sorting
Sort customer orders by timestamp.
Handles up to 1 million records efficiently.
Includes time complexity analysis and comparison with other sorting methods.

2. Quick Sort – Movie Recommendation Optimization
Sorts movies based on user-selected parameters.
Designed for high-traffic OTT systems.
Efficient for large datasets with fast response time.

3. Fractional Knapsack – Emergency Relief Supplies
Maximizes utility value of divisible relief items.
Handles weight constraints for boats during disaster relief.
Supports partial item selection.

4. Dijkstra’s Algorithm – Smart Traffic for Ambulances
Shortest path calculation in a dynamic traffic network.
Supports real-time weight updates.
Generates optimal path for emergency response navigation.

5. Multistage Graph – Logistics Route Optimization
Models delivery networks with multiple stages.
Uses DP/Dijkstra to find the most cost-efficient route.
Scalable for thousands of cities and dynamic constraints.

6. 0/1 Knapsack – Disaster Relief Truck Allocation
Selects the best combination of critical supplies.
Compares Brute Force, DP, and Greedy approaches.
Useful for real-time supply chain decisions.

7. Graph Coloring – University Exam Timetable
